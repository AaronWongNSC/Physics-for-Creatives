  <title>The Scientific Method(s)</title>

  <p>
    Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way
    to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By
    trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue
    what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a
    practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that
    those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how
    you might try to study biology.

    That said, it's not as if the ideas behind "the" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value
    to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in
    every context.

    If you search around the internet, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps of the scientific method.
    Here are a few examples:
