      One of the most basic tools of physics is the calculator. While it is certainly possible to do most of the calculations
      by hand, there's not a lot of value to that in the context of this course. But with that said, it puts an additional
      layer of importance for using your calculator correctly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the challenges of this section is that there are many different types of calculators out there, and they don't all
      have the same set of features. In fact, not all calculators behave the same way, and it's possible for two calculators to
      give different results for the same button presses. Rather than going into the details of different brands, we're going to
      take a high level overview of calculators and develop some basic strategies for how to avoid errors, regardless of how your
      specific calculator works.

    <title>Order of Operations</title>

    <p>
      One of the main errors (aside from pressing the wrong button) that can arise is when the desired calculation and the calculation that
      the calculator understands are not in alignment with each other. These are some of the most difficult errors to identify on the fly
      because your only indication that something went wrong is that the number is wrong. In some situations, the number you get is "obviously"
      wrong (such as getting a negative number when you know you should be getting a positive number). But the most common result is that
      a student dutifully copies the number the calculator gives them onto their paper, then moves forward from there without the slightest bit
      of hesitation.

      <idx><h>order of operations</h></idx>

      Underneath this problem is an understanding of the <term>order of operations</term>. When used in the mathematical context, this is interpreted
      as PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) or BOMDAS, which is understood to be a set of rules for how to interpret a mathematical expression.
      More broadly, however, it just means the order in which you do things. For example, socks-before-shoes is an order of operations. The reason we
      need to think about this broader sense is because not all calculators understand the mathematical order of operations the way that it's set up
      in mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the calculation <m>1 + 2 \times 3</m>. You would probably immediately recognize that you need to do the multiplication before the addition,
      and get the mathematically correct result of 7. But in order for you to know that, you had to see the whole problem before you strated. You had to
      know that the multiplication was at the end, and you used that information to determine how you were going to do the computation. Some calculators
      have this ability, but others do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>immediate execution (calculator)</h></idx>

      Some calculators use the <term>immediate execution</term> method of computation. This means that it tries to do the calculation as you type it in. And even
      within this category, there are calculators that can hold values in memory and those that can't. Let's analyze how one of these calculators might
      see this calculation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\boxed{1}</m>: The calculator understands that you're starting to type in a number. As long as you keep typing in digits, it will keep thinking
          that you're still typing in the number.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\boxed{+}</m>: You've now pressed a mathematical operation, so it knows that you're done with the first number. The next thing it is expecting
          is another number.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\boxed{2}</m>: Just as with the first step, as long as you're typing in numbers, it's waiting for you to finish telling it the number.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\boxed{\times}</m>: At this point, things can go in one of two ways. Some calculators will understand that you're done with the second number of
          the sum and do that calculation right away. Then it will use that result with the multiplication that you're about to give it. On the other hand,
          some calculators know about the mathematical order of operations, and it will know that it needs to do this multiplication first, then go back and
          add the other result. But in order to do that, it will also need to hold that original 1 in memory.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While there is more to the calculation, this is the critical step where things can fall apart. And this is why it's critical for you to know how
      your calculator works. Lots of students get problems wrong because of something as simple as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>infix notation (calculator)</h></idx>

      It's worth noting that there are some calculators that take the whole expression in before doing the calculation. These are sometimes called
      <term>infix notation</term> calculators. These behave more like how you would behave when looking at a calculation. You would use a logical system
      to determine which calculation needs to be performed first based on the order of operations, and then you would simplify from there. But infix notation
      also has order of operations pitfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the calculation <m>\frac{5}{2+3}</m>. You can easily see that this is equal to 1. But if you don't type it into the calculator correctly,
      it won't give you the desired result. Here is the button sequences that students would typically press:
      <m>\boxed{\strut 5}\boxed{\div}\boxed{2}\boxed{+}\boxed{3}</m>. And some students might even see <m>5/2+3</m> in the display and feel as though
      everything is correct. But how would the calculator see it?
