    In order to explore physics, we need to work with numbers and units. So before we launch into physics, we have
    to spend a little bit of time understanding what those things are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a seemingly simple question: What is the number three? Yes, you can draw the arabic numeral 3 and say 
    that this is 3. But that doesn't really get at the question, since there are lots of ways to write the number 3.
    We can also write three using a system of tally marks, or using numbers from a different language. Your next impulse
    might be to try gather three objects and say that these objects represent the number three. But is that true? How
    would we know from this that if we grabbed three other objects that those other things would also be three?
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out that the question of "What is a number?" is extremely complicated and can lead down rich paths of
    mathematical philosophy. For example, we can think about numbers in terms of their properties (numbers behave like
    this) or we can try to think about the "essence" of numbers (what makes a number a number and not something else?).
    And as you get deeper into the subject, you'll find that there is not a single simple answer to the question. (This is
    another example of how simple questions can lead to complicated answers.)
  </p>
  <p>
    For our purposes, we will stick with the idea that numbers are symbols that represent a quantity or an amount. You might
    ask, "A quantity or amount of what?" And that's a good question to ask. Numbers don't tell us that. They just represent
    the abstract concept of quantity or amount. In order to know what sorts of things we have quantities of, we have to add
    a unit.

    A <term>unit</term> is a word that represents a known quantity that represents a standard for a measurement. In casual contexts, the
    known quantity can be something simple like an apple. It makes sense for us to say that there are "five apples" on the table.
    However, from a more scientific perspective, an "apple" is not precise enough for us to use for our studies. What type of
    apples are they? And even if we have the same variety of apple (say, red delicious apples), they can be of many different
    weights and sizes. This makes for a very imprecise form of measurement.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Why are red delicious apples called that? If you've ever had them, they are perhaps among the least delicious apples that are
      out there! Apparently, they used to taste better, but over the years they have been bred for things like rotting slowly 
      and not being easily bruised, and not bred for taste. Basically, the red delicious apple is a victim of modern capitalism.

    When it comes to science, we have to use very precise quantities to avoid this type of variation. This will be the topic of the
    next section.
