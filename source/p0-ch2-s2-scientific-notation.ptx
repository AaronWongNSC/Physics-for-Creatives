      Scientific notation is a way of representing numbers that are very large or very small in a way that helps us to work with and interpret the
      numbers much more easily. This is best exhibited by an example. Which number is larger: 705745422424033592 or 70574542424033591? As you try
      to compare the digits, you can start to see the difficulty of working with very large numbers in this form. If you were clever, you might
      have tried to count the number of digits in each number, and that's the basic insight of scientific notation.

      <term>Scientific notation</term> is a way of writing numbers that are either too large or too small to be easily written and understood when
      written in standard form (the way we normally write numbers). Technically, we would say that a number is written in scientific notation if
      it is of the form <m>N \times 10^m</m>, where <m>1 \leq N &lt; 10</m> and <m>m</m> is an integer. We call <m>N</m> the <term>coefficient</term>
      and <m>m</m> the <term>exponent</term>.
