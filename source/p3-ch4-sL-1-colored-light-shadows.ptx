    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
      For this lab, we are going to start by using a set of red, blue, and green lights to get a white light. Then we will create
      shadows and various colors and try to understand the ways that lights are combining to create those colors.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create a "wall" using the white paper. You need a place to shine your lights and create shadows. This could be a piece of
          paper leaning against a book or a binder, or even just folded in half. It only needs to stand a few inches tall.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the paper for the shadows, create two thin strips that are a few inches long and an inch wide. You will want a clean
          side edge where the two strips can be brought together like a curtain. The exact dimensions are not important. In one of
          the strips, create a slit that is about a quarter inch in width. Use the diagram below as a model.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Line up the three flashlights side-by-side pointing towards the wall. Make a note of which light is in which location.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Darken the room as much as possible and turn on the lights. (Note: If the flashlights have multiple settings, pick the
          brightest non-blinking option.) Position them so that they combine into a white light in the middle. There may be other
          colors on the edges, but we're not going to worry about that. From this point forward, you may want to take pictures or video
          of the lab for future reference.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Hold one of the strips of paper between the lights and the wall. You should see three lines of light of different colors if
          you move it close enough to the wall. Identify the colors. Think about why you see the colors that you see in the order that
          they are in.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Hold the pencil between the lights and the wall. You should see three shadows of different colors. Identify the
          colors. Now add a second pencil to create more shadows. Explore the interactions of different shadows with each other
          and record 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Put the two shadow papers end-to-end like a closed curtain and position them between the lights and the wall. Slowly separate
          the two papers to reveal a thin slit. You should see three light lines. Continue pulling the papers apart and watch how the
          lines spread out. When they touch each other, make a note of the colors that are created. As they continue to get further apart,
          you will eventually have just two shadows, one from each piece of paper. You may want to make a video recording of this for future
          reference.

    <title>Discussion</title>
      
    <p>
      After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions. Some simple diagrams have been included to help you to
      explain your observations.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the first phase, you created three lines of light. Explain why the lights appear in the order that they do.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the second phase, you started by creating a set of three colored shadows. Explain why you see the colors that you saw in the
          order that you saw them.
        </p>
