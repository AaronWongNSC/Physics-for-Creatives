  <introduction>
    <p>
      Science is both a branch of knowledge and a process for obtaining knowledge. In other words, science is something
      that is both known and done. In this course, we are going to approach science using both lenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, this is a course of conceptual physics for students of the media arts. We're going to spend time learning
      about important concepts of the branch of science known as physics, and we're also going to try to use scientific
      methods to learn more about how those ideas can be applied in film, photography, and other forms of art. The idea is that
      you would start to develop some basic intuition for the field of physics without bogging you down with  But before
      we can talk about those things, we need to ground ourselves in the basics of science.
