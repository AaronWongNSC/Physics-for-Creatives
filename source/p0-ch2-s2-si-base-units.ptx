    The units used in modern science are known as SI units. <term>SI</term> stands for the "International System of Units"
    (from the French <em>Système international d'unités</em>). These units were created by an organization called the <term>International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures</term> and is an agreed-upon standard that is officially used by almost every country in the world and
    the entirety of the modern scientific community. We are going to take a brief tour of the seven base units, which form the foundation
    for all other scientific units.

      A <term>second</term> is a unit of time. Measuring the passage of time is something that we use in our daily lives and the second
      is the smallest common unit of time that we use for that purpose. But the technical definition of a second is somewhat surprising.
      The statement below is taken from the <url href="https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9.pdf">9th edition...</url>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, <m>\Delta_{\nu_{\text{Cs}}}</m>, the
        unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz,
        which is equal to <m>\text{s}^{-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What does this mean? Basically, it means that a second is <em>defined</em> by (basically) watching an atom and counting how quickly it
      bounces back and forth between two states. After about 9 billion of those transitions have occured, we say that a second has passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, seconds have been a subdivision of a long unit of time. You would take a day, break it into 24 hours, break each hour into
      60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and that would result in having a second be <m>\frac{1}{86400}</m> of a day. The problem with
      this definition is that a day is not a fixed unit of time. It turns out that the spin of the earth is decreasing at a rate of about 1.8
      milliseconds every century (and this is only an average). This means that our measurements would be slowly shifting as well, and that's not
      what we want to see out of our science.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a deeper level, it ties our concept of time to something that's not consistently measurable. If we were able to get a consistent and perfectly
      exact measurement of a day (and this time period is something that never changes), then we could theoretically tie our calculations to it. But
      we can't, and so scientists have tried to come up with something that they think would satisfy the requirements.

        While this may seem random, we have used vibrations of quartz crystals to keep consistent time since the 1940s. And that was the start of the
        pathway that has taken us to where we are.
