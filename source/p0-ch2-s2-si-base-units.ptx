    The units used in modern science are known as SI units. <term>SI</term> stands for the "International System of Units"
    (from the French <em>Système international d'unités</em>). These units were created by an organization called the <term>International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures</term> and is an agreed-upon standard that is officially used by almost every country in the world and
    the entirety of the modern scientific community. We are going to take a brief tour of the seven base units, which form the foundation
    for all other scientific units.

      A <term>second</term> is a unit of time. Measuring the passage of time is something that we use in our daily lives and the second
      is the smallest common unit of time that we use for that purpose. But the technical definition of a second is somewhat surprising.
      The statement below is taken from the <url href="https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9.pdf">9th edition...</url>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, <m>\Delta_{\nu_{\text{Cs}}}</m>, the
        unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz,
        which is equal to <m>\text{s}^{-1}</m>.
