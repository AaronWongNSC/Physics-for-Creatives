      While most of the world and all of science operates using the metric system, daily life in the US usually revolves around the
      <term>imperial system</term> of measurement. This is the system of quarts, gallons, feet, and miles that you're probably most
      accustomed to seeing. In fact, there are only three countries in the world that officially operate on the imperial system!
      (The other two countries are Liberia and Myanmar.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason the imperial system is called that is because it was originally the system of units imposed on countries by the British
      Empire during the time of colonialism (imperial means "of the empire"). Somewhat confusingly, the imperial system wasn't formalized
      until the 1820s. Before that, there was a vast array of customary measures used in various locations, some of which date back to the
      1500s (and potentially even earlier).
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual origins of individual measurements were often rather arbitrary. For example, the length we call a foot today was originally
      the length of King Henry I's foot. And an inch has been defined muliple ways, including the length of three grains of barley laid end-to-end
      and the length of twelve poppy seeds. There are also other historical measurements that are similarly arbitrary, such as a cubit (the length
      from your elbow to the tip of your outstretched middle finger) and a league (the distance a person can walk in an hour). Of course, differences
      in individual human bodies made these measurements to be rough estimates at best. And the convoluted history and origins of these measurements
      have led to the equally convoluted relationships between them, such as 5280 feet in a mile.

    <p>
      For this lab, we are going to explore some more of the history of different units and practice making unit conversions using the imperial system.

    <title>Procedure</title>

    <p>
        This lab consists of doing a little bit of research and a lot of calculations. The examples below show how unit your conversion calculations
        should be organized.
