          Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.

    One of the unusual quirks about light is that it always appears to be traveling the same speed, regardless of who is measuring it and the speed
    and direction they are going. Although the words that describe this phenomenon are quite striaght-forward, the reality of this is utterly bizarre.

    To start to understand what this means, we need to do some simple thought experiments. Let's say that you have a gun that shoots a pellet at a
    speed of 20 miles per hour. And let's say that you're shooting this from a car that is also traveling at 20 miles per hour. If you are shooting
    the gun forward, how fast will the pellet go (ignoring air resistance)? You would likely say that it's traveling at 40 miles per hour, 
    20 miles per hour from the car plus 20 miles per hour from the gun. This is know as <term>classical velocity addition</term>.
