<div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">kilogram</dfn> is a unit of mass. <dfn class="terminology">Mass</dfn> is a somewhat complicated quantity to measure because it gets mixed up with a related but different concept of <dfn class="terminology">weight</dfn>. The mass is basically the amount of matter in the object. If there’s more mass in one object than another, it means that there’s more matter in that object compared to the other. But how would we know how much matter there is? Our first intuition might be to weight it, and then we can say that there’s more matter in the one that weighs more. This leads to the correct conclusion, but it’s deceptive about the nature of matter.</div>
