<div class="para"> The units used in modern science are known as SI units. <dfn class="terminology">SI</dfn> stands for the "International System of Units" (from the French <em class="emphasis">Système international d’unités</em>). These units were created by an organization called the <dfn class="terminology">International Bureau of Weights and Measures</dfn> and is an agreed-upon standard that is officially used by almost every country in the world and the entirety of the modern scientific community. We are going to take a brief tour of the seven base units, which form the foundation for all other scientific units.</div>
