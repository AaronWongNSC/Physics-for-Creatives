<div class="para"> Ultimately, a better word for these is to call them "models." A model is just a particular representation of a scientific idea. A model makes no declarations about what is "true" about the universe. It simply says that under a certain set of assumptions, we would expect the universe to behave in a certain way. Whether or not that happens in reality is an entirely different question. In physics, itâ€™s very common to be working in the framework of models instead of debating between theories and laws.</div>
