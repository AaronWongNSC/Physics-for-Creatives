<div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">meter</dfn> is a unit of distance, and it is the distance that light travels in <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{299792458}\)</span> of a second. It turns out that this is about 39 inches, or a few inches longer than a yard. But why would this be the definition? It turns out that one of the laws of physics is that the speed of light is the same for all observers. This claim takes a bit to unpack, because it’s a deeply unintuitive result that leads to all sorts of interesting consequences. So for now, we’ll just say that the speed of light is a universal constant, which makes it a useful value for making measurements. The specific denominator of the fraction comes the speed of light being exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. And this also presents a chicken-and-egg problem. We use the speed of light to define a distance, but then we can’t make sense of that distance that without measuring the speed of light.</div>
