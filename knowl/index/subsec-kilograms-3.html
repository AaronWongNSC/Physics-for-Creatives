<div class="para"> You might be familiar with the idea that objects weigh less on the moon than they do on earth, and this is related to the concept of <dfn class="terminology">gravity</dfn>. Since the gravity changes from one location to another, it makes it hard to really use gravity as the way to determine mass. In fact, if we were to put objects into orbit on the <dfn class="terminology">International Space Station</dfn> (or ISS), we could not use weight at all since everything would weigh nothing! So a better concept of mass is to think about <dfn class="terminology">inertia</dfn>, which is a measure of how hard it is to change the motion of something. Even though objects have no weight in space, it still takes a certain amount of effort to move them. Objects with more mass are harder to move than objects with less mass. And the difficulty of moving an object (not its weight) is what we should be thinking of when we think about mass.</div>
