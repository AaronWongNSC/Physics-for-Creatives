<div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">unit</dfn> is a word that represents a known quantity that represents a standard for a measurement. In casual contexts, the known quantity can be something simple like an apple. It makes sense for us to say that there are "five apples" on the table. However, from a more scientific perspective, an "apple" is not precise enough for us to use for our studies. What type of apples are they? And even if we have the same variety of apple (say, red delicious apples), they can be of many different weights and sizes. This makes for a very imprecise form of measurement.</div>
