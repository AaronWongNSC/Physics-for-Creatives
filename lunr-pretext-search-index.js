  "body": " The Scientific Method(s)   Science!   The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.   Adam Savage (Mythbusters)   If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps. Here are a few examples:     Khan Academy's Introduction to Biology : (1) Make an observation; (2) Ask a question; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Make a prediction; (5) Test the prediction; (6) Iterate     University of Nevada Reno Extension's Fact Sheet on the Scientific Method : (1) Make an observation; (2) Define the problem; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Conduct the experiment; (5) Derive a theory     Your Dictionary's Article on the Scientific Method : (1) Define purpose; (2) Construct hypothesis; (3) Test hypothesis and collect data; (4) Analyze data; (5) Draw conclusion; (6) Communicate results    There are more examples in an article found in the CBE Life Sciences Education journal that explores the topic much more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.  So what's really happening here? The reality is that there is no single scientific method. There are scientists who are out there doing science, but each field (and each sub-field) has particular ways that science is practiced. However, there is some value in presenting a general framework, even if it's not completely general or completely correct, because it provides some basic guideposts to help students start to move towards scientific thinking. And so that is the  Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how you might try to study biology.  That said, it's not as if the ideas behind \"the\" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in every context.  "
