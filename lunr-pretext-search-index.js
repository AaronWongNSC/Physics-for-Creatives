  "body": " The Scientific Method(s)    The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.   Adam Savage (Mythbusters)   If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps. Here are a few examples:     Khan Academy's Introduction to Biology : (1) Make an observation; (2) Ask a question; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Make a prediction; (5) Test the prediction; (6) Iterate     University of Nevada Reno Extension's Fact Sheet on the Scientific Method : (1) Make an observation; (2) Define the problem; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Conduct the experiment; (5) Derive a theory     Your Dictionary's Article on the Scientific Method : (1) Define purpose; (2) Construct hypothesis; (3) Test hypothesis and collect data; (4) Analyze data; (5) Draw conclusion; (6) Communicate results    There are more examples in an article found in the CBE Life Sciences Education journal that explores the topic much more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.  So what's really happening here? Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how you might try to study biology.  That said, it's not as if the ideas behind \"the\" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in every context.  In this book, we are interested in trying to make the study of physics both practical and conceptual, but without getting too bogged down in unnecessary details. And trying to provide a precise formulation of the scientific is one of those unnecessary details. Instead, we will opt for a much more informal presentation of what the scientific method is.   An Informal Scientific Method   Scientific methodology is a two-step process of making observations and formulating ideas based on those observations. In many cases, the ideas that are formulate lead to the creation of experiments in order to generate additional observations that can be used to refine the ideas that have been formulated.    This two-step understanding of the scientific method is probably the simplest way to think about the process of doing science. If we go back to the examples of the scientific method found on the internet, we can see that the two steps of making observations and formulating ideas are well-represented. Throughout this book, we will be referring back to these two steps as part of how we try to advance our knowledge of physics.  "

  "title": "Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models",
  "body": " Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models    In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!   Homer Simpson   Another area of scientific thinking where it's possible to try to get unnecessarily rigorous is the distinction between hypotheses, theories, and laws. There is no underlying rule that allows us to classify each of these into neat groupings, and even the language itself is inconsistent. So this conversation ends up being more less accurate the more that we try to make it rigorous.  Typically, the word \"hypothesis\" is reserved for ideas we have that we are testing. For example, if we make a prediction about what is going to happen in a physics lab, we would typically call that idea a hypothesis. The whole point of making hypotheses is that it forces us to put our ideas into words that can be meaningfully tested for accuracy. After we make further observations (such as by running an experiment), we can then go back to those words and determine whether they were right or wrong (or at least mostly right or mostly wrong), and that leads us into the act of refining our ideas.  The words \"theory\" and \"law\" are actually much less precise. Some might try to talk about these as two different levels of knowledge and testability, where a \"theory\" is an idea that has been well-tested, but a \"law\" is so well-tested that we just don't ever expect it to be violated. However, this just isn't the case in physics.  For example, there's something known as \"Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\" that is a formula that we can use to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects. The problem with this \"law\" is that it's not actually a law. The reason is that the law isn't perfectly correct. There are many observations we can make that would violate this law, such as looking at the orbits of planets around the sun.  There's also \"Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity\" which (among other things) establishes the idea that nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Up to this point, there are no known violations of this. And so it would seem we should call this a \"law\" instead of a theory. But the language around this is so deeply rooted in history that it's a change that will never happen.  Ultimately, a better word for these is to call them \"models.\" A model is just a particular representation of a scientific idea. A model makes no declarations about what is \"true\" about the universe. It simply says that under a certain set of assumptions, we would expect the universe to behave in a certain way. Whether or not that happens in reality is an entirely different question. In physics, it's very common to be working in the framework of models instead of debating between theories and laws.  For example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation gives us a formula for how much force we expect there to be between two massive objects, and it is known to be accurate when the masses aren't too large. But when the objects get larger, we may have to turn to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to make better predictions.  Our approach to physics will be built around creating models for various situations. Those models will give us a theoretical foundation with which to analyze what might happen, and we will discuss things that can happen that will cause those models to fail.  "
