  "body": " The Scientific Method(s)     The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind.   Thomas Henry Huxley    If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps. Here are a few examples:     Khan Academy's Introduction to Biology : (1) Make an observation; (2) Ask a question; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Make a prediction; (5) Test the prediction; (6) Iterate     University of Nevada Reno Extension's Fact Sheet on the Scientific Method : (1) Make an observation; (2) Define the problem; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Conduct the experiment; (5) Derive a theory     Your Dictionary's Article on the Scientific Method : (1) Define purpose; (2) Construct hypothesis; (3) Test hypothesis and collect data; (4) Analyze data; (5) Draw conclusion; (6) Communicate results    There are more examples in an article found in the CBE Life Sciences Education journal that explores the topic much more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.  So what's really happening here? Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how you might try to study biology.  That said, it's not as if the ideas behind \"the\" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in every context.  In this book, we are interested in trying to make the study of physics both practical and conceptual, but without getting too bogged down in unnecessary details. And trying to provide a precise formulation of the scientific is one of those unnecessary details. Instead, we will opt for a much more informal presentation of what the scientific method is.   scientific method (informal)  informal scientific method  An Informal Scientific Method   Scientific methodology is a two-step process of making observations and formulating ideas based on those observations. In many cases, the ideas that are formulated lead to the creation of experiments in order to generate additional observations that can be used to refine those ideas.    This two-step understanding of the scientific method is probably the simplest way to think about the process of doing science. If we go back to the examples of the scientific method found on the internet, we can see that the two steps of making observations and formulating ideas are well-represented. Throughout this book, we will be referring back to these two steps as part of how we try to advance our knowledge of physics.  More importantly, this framework helps to establish something that Thomas Huxley (the person quoted at the start of the section) was getting at with his ideas. Here's a longer quote from his essay \"On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phenomena of Organic Nature\":   The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind. It is simply the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about, rendered precise and exact. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely-graduated weights. It is not that the action of the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but the beam of one is set on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight.  You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar example. You have all heard it repeated, I dare say, that men of science work by means of induction and deduction, and that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, wring from Nature certain other things, which are called natural laws, and causes, and that out of these, by some cunning skill of their own, they build up hypotheses and theories. And it is imagined by many, that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special apprenticeship to the craft. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.   In other words, the idea he's putting forward is that scientific thinking is just regular thinking, but more refined. There is no \"magic\" in the scientific method that is reserved only for scientists doing real science. It's just a way of learning that is very similar to how people all over the world learn things. We pay attention to what's going on around us, we have ideas for what's happening, and then we see how those ideas play out in reality, and we allow that reality to refine our thinking a little bit more.

  "title": "Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models",
  "body": " Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models    In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!   Homer Simpson   Another area of scientific thinking where it's possible to try to get unnecessarily rigorous is the distinction between hypotheses, theories, and laws. There is no underlying rule that allows us to classify each of these into neat groupings, and even the language itself is inconsistent. So this conversation ends up being more less accurate the more that we try to make it rigorous.  Typically, the word \"hypothesis\" is reserved for ideas we have that we are testing. For example, if we make a prediction about what is going to happen in a physics lab, we would typically call that idea a hypothesis. The whole point of making hypotheses is that it forces us to put our ideas into words that can be meaningfully tested for accuracy. After we make further observations (such as by running an experiment), we can then go back to those words and determine whether they were right or wrong (or at least mostly right or mostly wrong), and that leads us into the act of refining our ideas.  The words \"theory\" and \"law\" are actually much less precise. Some might try to talk about these as two different levels of knowledge and testability, where a \"theory\" is an idea that has been well-tested, but a \"law\" is so well-tested that we just don't ever expect it to be violated. However, this just isn't the case in physics.  For example, there's something known as \"Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\" that is a formula that we can use to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects. The problem with this \"law\" is that it's not actually a law. The reason is that the law isn't perfectly correct. There are many observations we can make that would violate this law, such as looking at the orbits of planets around the sun. (If you measure things accurately enough, you would discover that the predictions are close, but not quite correct.)  There's also \"Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity\" which (among other things) establishes the idea that nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Up to this point, there are no known violations of this. And so it would seem we should call this a \"law\" instead of a theory. But the language around this is so deeply rooted in history that it's a change that will never happen.   model Ultimately, a better word for these is to call them \"models.\" A model is just a particular representation of a scientific idea. A model makes no declarations about what is \"true\" about the universe. It simply says that under a certain set of assumptions, we would expect the universe to behave in a certain way. Whether or not that happens in reality is an entirely different question. In physics, it's very common to be working in the framework of models instead of debating between theories and laws.  For example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation gives us a formula for how much force we expect there to be between two massive objects, and it is known to be accurate when the masses aren't too large. But when the objects get larger, we may have to turn to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to make better predictions.  Our approach to physics will be built around creating models for various situations. Those models will give us a theoretical foundation with which to analyze what might happen, and we will discuss things that can happen that will cause those models to fail.

  "body": " Physics Labs    The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.   Adam Savage (Mythbusters)   Physics labs are simply a formal structure that give us opportunities to practice making observations and formulating ideas. In this book, we set them up in a very formal way because it's the best way to really slow down the process and allow deeper insights to settle in.  Your lab report should be understood as a completely self-contained document that describes what happened in the lab and what you learned from it. You should not assume that the person reading your lab report has access to the textbook or the lab procedures. All of that information must be included in your report. If the lab procedure has reflection questions, you should copy those questions into the appropriate section, and not just write down a number and your answers.  A carefully written lab report is much more than just presenting experimental data. It's a reflection of your ability to communicate the ideas that you have been asked to consider. It's also important to understand that not all labs work out perfectly, and sometimes you get results that are different than what is expected. Part of your job as a scientific thinker is to try to understand and explain discrepancies between the anticipated results and the actual results. In many cases, there is more to learn when something goes wrong compared to when everything goes right.  The following outline should be used for all lab activities:    Title and Header: This section is mostly for organization purposes. You should use the title that is stated in the lab procedures, but if you want to come up with a clever subtitle, you may certainly add one in. The remainder of the header information is the name of the group members. Typically, lab groups will be limited to three members, but your instructor may decide differently.    Introduction: This is where you state the overall objectives of the experiment. You will also want to include a discussion of the relevant concepts associated with the objectives. In a sense, you should think about this as the section that teaches the reader everything they need to know in order to understand the experiment you are about to run.    Procedure: This is where you explain the step-by-step procedure that you were meant to follow, and indications of any times that you deviated from that. This part should be detailed enough that someone else can follow the instructions to attempt to replicate your experiment. Your steps should be numbered, but your explanations of what happened should be written as paragraphs. Sometimes, a parts list will be provided at the beginning, especially if the lab requires multiple pieces of equipment.    Results and Data: This section is where you record what happened. Typically, while you're actually running the experiment you'll be keeping your data recorded in a lab notebook or on other paper. When it comes to putting that data into a lab report, you are not simply copying over that information, but you are organizing it so that it is as legible and understandable as possible. This may mean that you put the data into tables and a graph, or maybe it's just a written description of observations at different times. This section also includes relevant calculations. This does not mean that you should include all of your scratch work. It should contain just the relevant calculations and a minimal amount of information or explanation (if needed) for what those calculations represent. It should not be a solid wall of formulas.    Discussion: This is where the heart of the report lives. All of the other work that you've done leads up to this section. Here is where you will respond to the questions that are contained in the lab. Your goal is to demonstrate that you've learned something from the observations you made while executing the lab. These questions should all revolve around the objectives that you presented in the introduction. When possible, you should make direct reference to the objectives for emphasis. In many cases, this may also include an error analysis, where you talk about the things that went wrong and how those things might be addressed if you were to do the experiment again.    Conclusion: Write a paragraph or two that summarizes the lab and what you learned from it.

  "title": "Becoming a Curious Thinker",
  "body": " Becoming a Curious Thinker   Introduction  How well do you understand the world around you? The first lab activity is designed to cultivate a mind that is curious and willing to ask questions, even if they seem mundane. Because it turns out that the world is a fascinating place if you're willing to explore it.  We are going to visit a few different locations and engage in the practice of asking deep questions and trying to think about how we might get answers to those questions. In some situations, the answer might be to just search the internet for an explanation. But try to push beyond internet searches and think about how you might try to answer the question in other ways. Try to be clever and unorthodox, if you can.  Note that some questions will be dependent upon the specific context, and a general answer won't be good enough. In those cases, maybe the way to get an answer is to gather samples or data, and then maybe conduct some type of experiment. In some cases, you might not even know what types of experiments you could run to answer the question, in which case you might want to do a little background research on the internet to see if there are any easy answers. Ultimately, this activity is not about actually doing the research to get the answers, just the practice of asking the questions and taking the first steps towards starting the research.    Procedure  We are going to explore the following locations: the classroom, the building, the world outside of the building, and your home. At each location, we're going to complete the following steps:    Identify 5-7 objects in the space.    Pick 1 object to ask questions about.    Write down a list of at least 5 questions about it. (Feel free to ask more!)    Pick 3 of those questions and determine how you might go about finding the answer to those questions.      Bedroom Example    Location: Bedroom    Objects of Interest: Light switch, mattress, dresser, lamp, sheets, carpet, T-shirt    Questions about the light switch:    How does it work?    How much electricity flows through it?    What is it made of?    How is it manufactured?    Are there other types of light switches? What makes them different?    How easy is it to fix or repair a broken light switch?      Finding answers:    How does it work? -- There's probably a YouTube video that explains this. We could also try to take it apart and see if we can see the mechanism.    How much electricity flows through it? -- We would need a device that can be used to measure the amount of electricity. A quick internet search shows that such a device is called a \"multimeter\".    What is it made of? -- The outside appears to be a type of plastic, and there might be a kit that can be used to determine the type of plastic it is. But the inside part probably has some metal in it because electricity doesn't flow through plastic. We might have to use a different type of kit to test for different types of metals.        Parking Lot Example    Location: Parking Lot    Objects of Interest: Cars, trees, birds, dumpster, painted stripes    Questions about the cars:    How many cars are in the parking lot?    How many cars are normally in the parking lot?    How many cars does the parking lot hold?    What is the most common type of car in the parking lot?    How much does a car weigh?    How many cars are hybrid or electric?    How many of the cars are not locked?      Finding Answers:    How many cars are in the parking lot? -- We can try to count them, but cars might come and go while we're doing that. So maybe it's better to take a pictures of the parking lot and count from the photos. Having a drone might be useful because then we could take an overhead view of the parking lot.    How many cars are normally in the parking lot? -- We could count the number of cars at different times and then create a graph of the results. Or we can have someone monitor the entrances and exits to see when cars come and go and use that information to count the cars throughout the day.    How many of the cars are not locked? -- We could go through the parking lot and try to open the car doors and see how many of them open. [Note: Do NOT do this! We're just speculating on ways we can find the answer.] We can also observe people as they walk to the car to see how many of them need to unlock the car before getting in. We would have to be close enough to hear the car locks in case someone has keyless car entry.        Discussion  After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions:    Which location was it easiest to identify objects to ask questions about? And which location was it the most difficult? Why do you think that was the case?    What object was easiest to ask questions about? Were there any objects that you intentionally didn't pick because you thought it would be hard to come up with questions about it?    What was the most clever way you came up with for answering one of your questions? What did you think was clever about it?    Are there any questions that you actually want to know the answer to? If so, which ones? And why do you want to know?      Conclusion  As you went through the exercise, you should have found that some questions have answers that seem to be easily accessible, while others were complicated enough that you really need a lot of information to even begin the process of answering the question. The world we live in is extremely complex, and we take a lot of it for granted. And all it takes is a curious mind to begin to peel back the layers.    Lab Write-Up Guidance  Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.    Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?    Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.    Procedure  This lab has you executing the same procedure in a few different locations. You do not need to write out the procedure multiple times. Find a nice way of organizing it so it's clear what you were expected to do.    Results and Data  For this lab, the results and data consist of lists and sentences. You can use the examples in the lab activity to give you some ideas for how to organize your work.    Discussion  Answer the discussion questions. Be sure that you state the original question and organize it in a way that is easy to follow.    Conclusion  Write a couple paragraphs about the lab. What, if anything, did you learn from it? And if you didn't learn anything, is there something that could have been done differently that would make the lab better?

  "title": "Calculators",
  "body": " Calculators     Calculators can only calculate - they cannot do mathematics.   John A. Van de Walle   One of the most basic tools of physics is the calculator. While it is certainly possible to do most of the calculations by hand, there's not a lot of value to that in the context of this course. But with that said, it puts an additional layer of importance for using your calculator correctly.  One of the challenges of this section is that there are many different types of calculators out there, and they don't all have the same set of features. In fact, not all calculators behave the same way, and it's possible for two calculators to give different results for the same button presses. Rather than going into the details of different brands, we're going to take a high level overview of calculators and develop some basic strategies for how to avoid errors, regardless of how your specific calculator works.    Order of Operations  One of the main errors (aside from pressing the wrong button) that can arise is when the desired calculation and the calculation that the calculator understands are not in alignment with each other. These are some of the most difficult errors to identify on the fly because your only indication that something went wrong is that the number is wrong. In some situations, the number you get is \"obviously\" wrong (such as getting a negative number when you know you should be getting a positive number). But the most common result is that a student dutifully copies the number the calculator gives them onto their paper, then moves forward from there without the slightest bit of hesitation.   order of operations Underneath this problem is an understanding of the order of operations . When used in the mathematical context, this is interpreted as PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) or BOMDAS, which is understood to be a set of rules for how to interpret a mathematical expression. More broadly, however, it just means the order in which you do things. For example, socks-before-shoes is an order of operations. The reason we need to think about this broader sense is because not all calculators understand the mathematical order of operations the way that it's set up in mathematics.  Consider the calculation . You would probably immediately recognize that you need to do the multiplication before the addition, and get the mathematically correct result of 7. But in order for you to know that, you had to see the whole problem before you strated. You had to know that the multiplication was at the end, and you used that information to determine how you were going to do the computation. Some calculators have this ability, but others do not.   immediate execution (calculator) Some calculators use the immediate execution method of computation. This means that it tries to do the calculation as you type it in. And even within this category, there are calculators that can hold values in memory and those that can't. Let's analyze how one of these calculators might see this calculation.     : The calculator understands that you're starting to type in a number. As long as you keep typing in digits, it will keep thinking that you're still typing in the number.     : You've now pressed a mathematical operation, so it knows that you're done with the first number. The next thing it is expecting is another number.     : Just as with the first step, as long as you're typing in numbers, it's waiting for you to finish telling it the number.     : At this point, things can go in one of two ways. Some calculators will understand that you're done with the second number of the sum and do that calculation right away. Then it will use that result with the multiplication that you're about to give it. On the other hand, some calculators know about the mathematical order of operations, and it will know that it needs to do this multiplication first, then go back and add the other result. But in order to do that, it will also need to hold that original 1 in memory.    While there is more to the calculation, this is the critical step where things can fall apart. And this is why it's critical for you to know how your calculator works. Lots of students get problems wrong because of something as simple as this.   infix notation (calculator) It's worth noting that there are some calculators that take the whole expression in before doing the calculation. These are sometimes called infix notation calculators. These behave more like how you would behave when looking at a calculation. You would use a logical system to determine which calculation needs to be performed first based on the order of operations, and then you would simplify from there. But infix notation also has order of operations pitfalls.  Consider the calculation . You can easily see that this is equal to 1. But if you don't type it into the calculator correctly, it won't give you the desired result. Here is the button sequences that students would typically press: . And some students might even see in the display and feel as though everything is correct. But how would the calculator see it?    Calculator Strategies  Work in small chunks following the order of operations.  Calculate twice.       (Wikipedia) Calculator Input Methods)      "

  "title": "Numbers and Units",
  "body": " Numbers and Units    -----   ------   In order to explore physics, we need to work with numbers and units. So before we launch into physics, we have to spend a little bit of time understanding what those things are.  Here is a seemingly simple question: What is the number three? Yes, you can draw the arabic numeral 3 and say that this is 3. But that doesn't really get at the question, since there are lots of ways to write the number 3. We can also write three using a system of tally marks, or using numbers from a different language. Your next impulse might be to try gather three objects and say that these objects represent the number three. But is that true? How would we know from this that if we grabbed three other objects that those other things would also be three?  It turns out that the question of \"What is a number?\" is extremely complicated and can lead down rich paths of mathematical philosophy. For example, we can think about numbers in terms of their properties (numbers behave like this) or we can try to think about the \"essence\" of numbers (what makes a number a number and not something else?). And as you get deeper into the subject, you'll find that there is not a single simple answer to the question. (This is another example of how simple questions can lead to complicated answers.)  For our purposes, we will stick with the idea that numbers are symbols that represent a quantity or an amount. You might ask, \"A quantity or amount of what?\" And that's a good question to ask. Numbers don't tell us that. They just represent the abstract concept of quantity or amount. In order to know what sorts of things we have quantities of, we have to add a unit.   unit A unit is a word that represents a known quantity that represents a standard for a measurement. In casual contexts, the known quantity can be something simple like an apple. It makes sense for us to say that there are \"five apples\" on the table. However, from a more scientific perspective, an \"apple\" is not precise enough for us to use for our studies. What type of apples are they? And even if we have the same variety of apple (say, red delicious apples), they can be of many different weights and sizes. This makes for a very imprecise form of measurement.   Why are red delicious apples called that? If you've ever had them, they are perhaps among the least delicious apples that are out there! Apparently, they used to taste better, but over the years they have been bred for things like rotting slowly and not being easily bruised, and not bred for taste. Basically, the red delicious apple is a victim of modern capitalism.   When it comes to science, we have to use very precise quantities to avoid this type of variation. This will be the topic of the next section.  "

  "title": "SI Base Units",
  "body": " SI Base Units     I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it.   Lord Kelvin    SI  International Bureau of Weights and Measures The units used in modern science are known as SI units. SI stands for the \"International System of Units\" (from the French Système international d'unités ). These units were created by an organization called the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and is an agreed-upon standard that is officially used by almost every country in the world and the entirety of the modern scientific community. We are going to take a brief tour of a few of the units, which form the foundation for all other scientific units.    Seconds   second A second is a unit of time. Measuring the passage of time is something that we use in our daily lives and the second is the smallest common unit of time that we use for that purpose. But the technical definition of a second is somewhat surprising. The statement below is taken from the 9th edition of the \"SI brochure\" :   [The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, , the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to .   What does this mean? Basically, it means that a second is defined by watching an atom and counting how quickly it bounces back and forth between two states. After about 9 billion of those transitions have occured, we say that a second has passed.  Historically, seconds have been a subdivision of a long unit of time. You would take a day, break it into 24 hours, break each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and that would result in having a second be of a day. The problem with this definition is that a day is not a fixed unit of time. It turns out that the spin of the earth is decreasing at a rate of about 1.8 milliseconds every century (and this is only an average). This means that our measurements would be slowly shifting as well, and that's not what we want to see out of our science.  At a deeper level, it ties our concept of time to something that's not consistently measurable. If we were able to get a consistent and perfectly exact measurement of a day (and this time period is something that never changes), then we could theoretically tie our calculations to it. But we can't, and so scientists have tried to come up with something that they think would satisfy the requirements.   While this may seem random, we have used vibrations of quartz crystals to keep consistent time since the 1940s. And that was the start of the pathway that has taken us to where we are.     Meters   meter A meter is a unit of distance, and it is the distance that light travels in of a second. It turns out that this is about 39 inches, or a few inches longer than a yard. But why would this be the definition? It turns out that one of the laws of physics is that the speed of light is the same for all observers. This claim takes a bit to unpack, because it's a deeply unintuitive result that leads to all sorts of interesting consequences. So for now, we'll just say that the speed of light is a universal constant, which makes it a useful value for making measurements. The specific denominator of the fraction comes the speed of light being exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. And this also presents a chicken-and-egg problem. We use the speed of light to define a distance, but then we can't make sense of that distance that without measuring the speed of light.  Humans have been measuring distance for much longer than we have known the speed of light. And there were multiple iterations of the distance of a meter, but each of those were found to be imprecise. For example, an early definition of a meter was connected to the length of a particular pendulum to make it oscillate with a specific frequency, but that length turned out to be different in different locations (due to the fact that gravity changes with altitude). Another attempted meter was to define it to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, but that measurement assumes the earth is smooth enough to make that meaningful. And while neither of those two methods were perfect, they did create an expectation for what a meter ought to be. And so the choice of declaring that the speed of light is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second was to create an integer value that also wouldn't significantly alter the existing meter.    Kilograms   kilogram  mass  weight  force A kilogram is a unit of mass. Mass is a somewhat complicated quantity to measure because it gets mixed up with a related but different concept of weight . The mass is basically the amount of matter in the object. If there's more mass in one object than another, it means that there's more matter in that object compared to the other. But how would we know how much matter there is? Our first intuition might be to weight it, and then we can say that there's more matter in the one that weighs more. This leads to the correct conclusion, but it's deceptive about the nature of matter.   gravity  intertia  International Space Station (ISS) You might be familiar with the idea that objects weigh less on the moon than they do on earth, and this is related to the concept of gravity . Since the gravity changes from one location to another, it makes it hard to really use gravity as the way to determine mass. In fact, if we were to put objects into orbit on the International Space Station (or ISS), we could not use weight at all since everything would weigh nothing! So a better concept of mass is to think about inertia , which is a measure of how hard it is to change the motion of something. Even though objects have no weight in space, it still takes a certain amount of effort to move them. Objects with more mass are harder to move than objects with less mass. And the difficulty of moving an object (not its weight) is what we should be thinking of when we think about mass.  You might have noticed that we haven't given the definition of a kilogram yet. That's because the definition is connected to a quantity known as Planck's constant . This is the number that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. But to understand what that means, we would have to get into quantum mechanics, and that's just a lot to take in. So it's better to just hold the concept of mass without worrying about its formal definition.    The Other SI Units   ampere  kelvin  mole  candela There are four other SI units.     Ampere : A measure of electrical current     Kelvin : A measure of temperature     Mole : A measure of quantity     Candela : A measure of brightness of light    Each of these units have their own histories and complexities, but we will leave it as an exercise to explore that.

For example, speed is the measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time. This means that we can't have speed unless we have both distance and time. The purpose of the SI base units is that it gives us the foundation upon which we can build all of the other physics concepts. Everything from here forward will involve some combination of those units.  Here are some examples of some physics concepts and their associated units:    Speed ( ): A measure of how far an object travels in a particular amount of time.    Acceleration ( ): A measure of the change of speed over a period of time.    Force ( ): A measure of the push or pull applied to an object.    Some of the units are given names to simplify the concepts. For example, the unit of force is a Newton, and it can be understood as the amount of force needed to accelerate a one kilogram mass at the the rate of one meter per second squared. There are also some concepts that have units that are easily calculated, but are extremely challenging to describe directly. For example, momentum is calculated as the product of mass and velocity, but what it measures might be described as the amount of stored motion within a mass.  What else to say here?
