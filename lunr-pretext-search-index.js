  "title": "The Scientific Method(s)",
  "body": " The Scientific Method(s)    The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind.   Thomas Henry Huxley   If you search around the internet for explanations of the scientific method, you'll find that there isn't an agreement on the steps. Here are a few examples:     Khan Academy's Introduction to Biology : (1) Make an observation; (2) Ask a question; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Make a prediction; (5) Test the prediction; (6) Iterate     University of Nevada Reno Extension's Fact Sheet on the Scientific Method : (1) Make an observation; (2) Define the problem; (3) Form a hypothesis; (4) Conduct the experiment; (5) Derive a theory     Your Dictionary's Article on the Scientific Method : (1) Define purpose; (2) Construct hypothesis; (3) Test hypothesis and collect data; (4) Analyze data; (5) Draw conclusion; (6) Communicate results    There are more examples in an article found in the CBE Life Sciences Education journal that explores the topic much more deeply and in the context of K-12 science education standards in Kansas from 2005.  So what's really happening here? Most science textbooks start off by teaching students the scientific method, as if there is one precise way to do science. One of the main reasons for this is to try to establish the concept of scientific rigor. By trying to put everything into a simple box, it is possible to portray science as the ultimate way to pursue what is true. Unfortunately, this representation is wrong from both a historical perspective and from a practical perspective. It is probably most correct to say that there are many scientific methods, and that those methods vary from one field of study to the next. How you might try to study physics is different from how you might try to study biology.  That said, it's not as if the ideas behind \"the\" scientific method are completely wrong. There is still value to having a general framework as a guidepost, even if it's not completely general or completely accurate in every context.  In this book, we are interested in trying to make the study of physics both practical and conceptual, but without getting too bogged down in unnecessary details. And trying to provide a precise formulation of the scientific is one of those unnecessary details. Instead, we will opt for a much more informal presentation of what the scientific method is.   scientific method (informal)  informal scientific method  An Informal Scientific Method   Scientific methodology is a two-step process of making observations and formulating ideas based on those observations. In many cases, the ideas that are formulated lead to the creation of experiments in order to generate additional observations that can be used to refine those ideas.    This two-step understanding of the scientific method is probably the simplest way to think about the process of doing science. If we go back to the examples of the scientific method found on the internet, we can see that the two steps of making observations and formulating ideas are well-represented. Throughout this book, we will be referring back to these two steps as part of how we try to advance our knowledge of physics.  More importantly, this framework helps to establish something that Thomas Huxley (the person quoted at the start of the section) was getting at with his ideas. Here's a longer quote from his essay \"On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phenomena of Organic Nature\":   The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind. It is simply the mode at which all phenomena are reasoned about, rendered precise and exact. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely-graduated weights. It is not that the action of the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but the beam of one is set on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and of course turns by the addition of a much smaller weight.  You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar example. You have all heard it repeated, I dare say, that men of science work by means of induction and deduction, and that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, wring from Nature certain other things, which are called natural laws, and causes, and that out of these, by some cunning skill of their own, they build up hypotheses and theories. And it is imagined by many, that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special apprenticeship to the craft. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.   In other words, the idea he's putting forward is that scientific thinking is just regular thinking, but more refined. There is no \"magic\" in the scientific method that is reserved only for scientists doing real science. It's just a way of learning that is very similar to how people all over the world learn things. We pay attention to what's going on around us, we have ideas for what's happening, and then we see how those ideas play out in reality, and we allow that reality to refine our thinking a little bit more.

  "title": "Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models",
  "body": " Hypothesis, Theory, Law, and Models    In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!   Homer Simpson   Another area of scientific thinking where it's possible to try to get unnecessarily rigorous is the distinction between hypotheses, theories, and laws. There is no underlying rule that allows us to classify each of these into neat groupings, and even the language itself is inconsistent. So this conversation ends up being more less accurate the more that we try to make it rigorous.  Typically, the word \"hypothesis\" is reserved for ideas we have that we are testing. For example, if we make a prediction about what is going to happen in a physics lab, we would typically call that idea a hypothesis. The whole point of making hypotheses is that it forces us to put our ideas into words that can be meaningfully tested for accuracy. After we make further observations (such as by running an experiment), we can then go back to those words and determine whether they were right or wrong (or at least mostly right or mostly wrong), and that leads us into the act of refining our ideas.  The words \"theory\" and \"law\" are actually much less precise. Some might try to talk about these as two different levels of knowledge and testability, where a \"theory\" is an idea that has been well-tested, but a \"law\" is so well-tested that we just don't ever expect it to be violated. However, this just isn't the case in physics.  For example, there's something known as \"Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\" that is a formula that we can use to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects. The problem with this \"law\" is that it's not actually a law. The reason is that the law isn't perfectly correct. There are many observations we can make that would violate this law, such as looking at the orbits of planets around the sun. (If you measure things accurately enough, you would discover that the predictions are close, but not quite correct.)  There's also \"Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity\" which (among other things) establishes the idea that nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Up to this point, there are no known violations of this. And so it would seem we should call this a \"law\" instead of a theory. But the language around this is so deeply rooted in history that it's a change that will never happen.   model Ultimately, a better word for these is to call them \"models.\" A model is just a particular representation of a scientific idea. A model makes no declarations about what is \"true\" about the universe. It simply says that under a certain set of assumptions, we would expect the universe to behave in a certain way. Whether or not that happens in reality is an entirely different question. In physics, it's very common to be working in the framework of models instead of debating between theories and laws.  For example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation gives us a formula for how much force we expect there to be between two massive objects, and it is known to be accurate when the masses aren't too large. But when the objects get larger, we may have to turn to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to make better predictions.  Our approach to physics will be built around creating models for various situations. Those models will give us a theoretical foundation with which to analyze what might happen, and we will discuss things that can happen that will cause those models to fail.

  "title": "Physics Labs",
  "body": " Physics Labs    The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.   Adam Savage (Mythbusters)   Physics labs are simply a formal structure that give us opportunities to practice making observations and formulating ideas. In this book, we set them up in a very formal way because it's the best way to really slow down the process and allow deeper insights to settle in.  Your lab report should be understood as a completely self-contained document that describes what happened in the lab and what you learned from it. You should not assume that the person reading your lab report has access to the textbook or the lab procedures. All of that information must be included in your report. If the lab procedure has reflection questions, you should copy those questions into the appropriate section, and not just write down a number and your answers.  A carefully written lab report is much more than just presenting experimental data. It's a reflection of your ability to communicate the ideas that you have been asked to consider. It's also important to understand that not all labs work out perfectly, and sometimes you get results that are different than what is expected. Part of your job as a scientific thinker is to try to understand and explain discrepancies between the anticipated results and the actual results. In many cases, there is more to learn when something goes wrong compared to when everything goes right.  The following outline should be used for all lab activities:    Title and Header: This section is mostly for organization purposes. You should use the title that is stated in the lab procedures, but if you want to come up with a clever subtitle, you may certainly add one in. The remainder of the header information is the name of the group members. Typically, lab groups will be limited to three members, but your instructor may decide differently.    Introduction: This is where you state the overall objectives of the experiment. You will also want to include a discussion of the relevant concepts associated with the objectives. In a sense, you should think about this as the section that teaches the reader everything they need to know in order to understand the experiment you are about to run.    Procedure: This is where you explain the step-by-step procedure that you were meant to follow, and indications of any times that you deviated from that. This part should be detailed enough that someone else can follow the instructions to attempt to replicate your experiment. Your steps should be numbered, but your explanations of what happened should be written as paragraphs.    Results and Data: This section is where you record what happened. Typically, while you're actually running the experiment you'll be keeping your data recorded in a lab notebook or on other paper. When it comes to putting that data into a lab report, you are not simply copying over that information, but you are organizing it so that it is as legible and understandable as possible. This may mean that you put the data into tables and a graph, or maybe it's just a written description of observations at different times. This section also includes relevant calculations. This does not mean that you should include all of your scratch work. It should contain just the relevant calculations and a minimal amount of information or explanation (if needed) for what those calculations represent. It should not be a solid wall of formulas.    Discussion: This is where the heart of the report lives. All of the other work that you've done leads up to this section. Here is where you will respond to the questions that are contained in the lab. Your goal is to demonstrate that you've learned something from the observations you made while executing the lab. These questions should all revolve around the objectives that you presented in the introduction. When possible, you should make direct reference to the objectives for emphasis. In many cases, this may also include an error analysis, where you talk about the things that went wrong and how those things might be addressed if you were to do the experiment again.    Conclusion: Write a paragraph or two that summarizes the lab and what you learned from it.

  "body": " Lab Activities: The Scientific Method   Becoming a Curious Thinker   Introduction   How well do you understand the world around you? The first lab activity is designed to cultivate a mind that is curious and willing to ask questions, even if they seem mundane. Because it turns out that the world is a fascinating place if you're willing to explore it.  We are going to visit a few different locations and engage in the practice of asking deep questions and trying to think about how we might get answers to those questions. In some situations, the answer might be to just search the internet for an explanation. But try to push beyond internet searches and think about how you might try to answer the question in other ways. Try to be clever and unorthodox, if you can.  Note that some questions will be dependent upon the specific context, and a general answer won't be good enough. In those cases, maybe the way to get an answer is to gather samples or data, and then maybe conduct some type of experiment. In some cases, you might not even know what types of experiments you could run to answer the question, in which case you might want to do a little background research on the internet to see if there are any easy answers. Ultimately, this activity is not about actually doing the research to get the answers, just the practice of asking the questions and taking the first steps towards starting the research.     Procedure   We are going to explore the following locations: the classroom, the building, the world outside of the building, and your home. At each location, we're going to complete the following steps:    Identify 5-7 objects in the space.    Pick 1 object to ask questions about.    Write down a list of at least 5 questions about it. (Feel free to ask more!)    Pick 3 of those questions and determine how you might go about finding the answer to those questions.       Example 1    Location: Bedroom    Objects of Interest: Light switch, mattress, dresser, lamp, sheets, carpet, T-shirt    Questions about the light switch:    How does it work?    How much electricity flows through it?    What is it made of?    How is it manufactured?    Are there other types of light switches? What makes them different?    How easy is it to fix or repair a broken light switch?      Finding answers:    How does it work? -- There's probably a YouTube video that explains this. We could also try to take it apart and see if we can see the mechanism.    How much electricity flows through it? -- We would need a device that can be used to measure the amount of electricity. A quick internet search shows that such a device is called a \"multimeter\".    What is it made of? -- The outside appears to be a type of plastic, and there might be a kit that can be used to determine the type of plastic it is. But the inside part probably has some metal in it because electricity doesn't flow through plastic. We might have to use a different type of kit to test for different types of metals.        Example 2    Location: Parking Lot    Objects of Interest: Cars, trees, birds, dumpster, painted stripes    Questions about the cars:    How many cars are in the parking lot?    How many cars are normally in the parking lot?    How many cars does the parking lot hold?    What is the most common type of car in the parking lot?    How much does a car weigh?    How many cars are hybrid or electric?    How many of the cars are not locked?      Finding Answers:    How many cars are in the parking lot? -- We can try to count them, but cars might come and go while we're doing that. So maybe it's better to take a pictures of the parking lot and count from the photos. Having a drone might be useful because then we could take an overhead view of the parking lot.    How many cars are normally in the parking lot? -- We could count the number of cars at different times and then create a graph of the results. Or we can have someone monitor the entrances and exits to see when cars come and go and use that information to count the cars throughout the day.    How many of the cars are not locked? -- We could go through the parking lot and try to open the car doors and see how many of them open. [Note: Do NOT do this! We're just speculating on ways we can find the answer.] We can also observe people as they walk to the car to see how many of them need to unlock the car before getting in. We would have to be close enough to hear the car locks in case someone has keyless car entry.          Discussion   After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions:    Which location was it easiest to identify objects to ask questions about? And which location was it the most difficult? Why do you think that was the case?    What object was easiest to ask questions about? Were there any objects that you intentionally didn't pick because you thought it would be hard to come up with questions about it?    What was the best question you came up with? What are the features of it that make it a good question?    What was the most clever way you came up with for answering one of your questions? What did you think was clever about it?    Are there any questions that you actually want to know the answer to? If so, which ones? And why do you want to know?     Conclusion   As you went through the exercise, you should have found that some questions have answers that seem to be easily accessible, while others were complicated enough that you really need a lot of information to even begin the process of answering the question. The world we live in is extremely complex, and we take a lot of it for granted. And all it takes is a curious mind to begin to peel back the layers.     Lab Write-Up Guidance   Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.   Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?   Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.   Procedure  This lab has you executing the same procedure in a few different locations. You do not need to write out the procedure multiple times. Find a nice way of organizing it so it's clear what you were expected to do.   Results and Data  For this lab, the results and data consist of lists and sentences. You can use the examples in the lab activity to give you some ideas for how to organize your work.   Discussion  Answer the discussion questions. Be sure that you state the original question and organize it in a way that is easy to follow.   Conclusion  Write a couple paragraphs about the lab. What, if anything, did you learn from it? And if you didn't learn anything, is there something that could have been done differently that would make the lab better?

Example 1    Location: Bedroom    Objects of Interest: Light switch, mattress, dresser, lamp, sheets, carpet, T-shirt    Questions about the light switch:    How does it work?    How much electricity flows through it?    What is it made of?    How is it manufactured?    Are there other types of light switches? What makes them different?    How easy is it to fix or repair a broken light switch?      Finding answers:    How does it work? -- There's probably a YouTube video that explains this. We could also try to take it apart and see if we can see the mechanism.    How much electricity flows through it? -- We would need a device that can be used to measure the amount of electricity. A quick internet search shows that such a device is called a \"multimeter\".    What is it made of? -- The outside appears to be a type of plastic, and there might be a kit that can be used to determine the type of plastic it is. But the inside part probably has some metal in it because electricity doesn't flow through plastic. We might have to use a different type of kit to test for different types of metals.        Example 2    Location: Parking Lot    Objects of Interest: Cars, trees, birds, dumpster, painted stripes    Questions about the cars:    How many cars are in the parking lot?    How many cars are normally in the parking lot?    How many cars does the parking lot hold?    What is the most common type of car in the parking lot?    How much does a car weigh?    How many cars are hybrid or electric?    How many of the cars are not locked?      Finding Answers:    How many cars are in the parking lot? -- We can try to count them, but cars might come and go while we're doing that. So maybe it's better to take a pictures of the parking lot and count from the photos. Having a drone might be useful because then we could take an overhead view of the parking lot.    How many cars are normally in the parking lot? -- We could count the number of cars at different times and then create a graph of the results. Or we can have someone monitor the entrances and exits to see when cars come and go and use that information to count the cars throughout the day.    How many of the cars are not locked? -- We could go through the parking lot and try to open the car doors and see how many of them open. [Note: Do NOT do this! We're just speculating on ways we can find the answer.] We can also observe people as they walk to the car to see how many of them need to unlock the car before getting in. We would have to be close enough to hear the car locks in case someone has keyless car entry.          Discussion   After you've completed the tasks, answer the following discussion questions:   Which location was it easiest to identify objects to ask questions about? And which location was it the most difficult? Why do you think that was the case?  What object was easiest to ask questions about? Were there any objects that you intentionally didn't pick because you thought it would be hard to come up with questions about it?  What was the most clever way you came up with for answering one of your questions? What did you think was clever about it?  Are there any questions that you actually want to know the answer to? If so, which ones? And why do you want to know?    Conclusion   As you went through the exercise, you should have found that some questions have answers that seem to be easily accessible, while others were complicated enough that you really need a lot of information to even begin the process of answering the question. The world we live in is extremely complex, and we take a lot of it for granted. And all it takes is a curious mind to begin to peel back the layers.     Lab Write-Up Guidance   Use the following outline to help you write up your lab report completely and correctly.   Title and Header  What is the title of the lab and who was in the lab group?   Introduction  In your own words, what was the purpose of the lab activity? This should only take a few sentences for this lab.   Procedure  This lab has you executing the same procedure in a few different locations. You do not need to write out the procedure multiple times. Find a nice way of organizing it so it's clear what you were expected to do.   Results and Data  For this lab, the results and data consist of lists and sentences. You can use the examples in the lab activity to give you some ideas for how to organize your work.   Discussion  Answer the discussion questions. Be sure that you state the original question and organize it in a way that is easy to follow.   Conclusion  Write a couple paragraphs about the lab. What, if anything, did you learn from it? And if you didn't learn anything, is there something that could have been done differently that would make the lab better?

  "title": "Numbers and Units",
  "body": " Numbers and Units    -----   ------   In order to explore physics, we need to work with numbers and units. So before we launch into physics, we have to spend a little bit of time understanding what those things are.  Here is a seemingly simple question: What is the number three? Yes, you can draw the arabic numeral 3 and say that this is 3. But that doesn't really get at the question, since there are lots of ways to write the number 3. We can also write three using a system of tally marks, or using numbers from a different language. Your next impulse might be to try gather three objects and say that these objects represent the number three. But is that true? How would we know from this that if we grabbed three other objects that those other things would also be three?  It turns out that the question of \"What is a number?\" is extremely complicated and can lead down rich paths of mathematical philosophy. For example, we can think about numbers in terms of their properties (numbers behave like this) or we can try to think about the \"essence\" of numbers (what makes a number a number and not something else?). And as you get deeper into the subject, you'll find that there is not a single simple answer to the question. (This is another example of how simple questions can lead to complicated answers.)  For our purposes, we will stick with the idea that numbers are symbols that represent a quantity or an amount. You might ask, \"A quantity or amount of what?\" And that's a good question to ask. Numbers don't tell us that. They just represent the abstract concept of quantity or amount. In order to know what sorts of things we have quantities of, we have to add a unit.   unit A unit is a word that represents a known quantity that represents a standard for a measurement. In casual contexts, the known quantity can be something simple like an apple. It makes sense for us to say that there are \"five apples\" on the table. However, from a more scientific perspective, an \"apple\" is not precise enough for us to use for our studies. What type of apples are they? And even if we have the same variety of apple (say, red delicious apples), they can be of many different weights and sizes. This makes for a very imprecise form of measurement.   Why are red delicious apples called that? If you've ever had them, they are perhaps among the least delicious apples that are out there! Apparently, they used to taste better, but over the years they have been bred for things like rotting slowly and not being easily bruised, and not bred for taste. Basically, the red delicious apple is a victim of modern capitalism.   When it comes to science, we have to use very precise quantities to avoid this type of variation. This will be the topic of the next section.  "
